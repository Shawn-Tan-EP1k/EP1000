                    <h1>Introduction to Fusion 360</h1><hr>
                    <h3>Basics of Fusion 360</h3>
                    <p>In this lesson we learnt the basics on using Fusion 360. We started by making a nametag.</p>

                    <p>In the image above, I created a sketch using a set of guidelines found on blackboard. I first went to origin, right clicked on the xy plane and clicked create sketch. I made a 2 point rectangle starting from the origin point and adjusted the dimentions to 50mm by 15mm. I proceeded to fillet all corners by 4mm radius. The next thing I did was to create to keyhole loop. I made a 8mm diametre and a 4mm diametre at the midpoint of the left side of the keychain.</p>

                    <p>In this next image I extruded the sketch. Right after creating the sketch I went to the "Solids" tab and clicked extrude. I selected the surfaces I wish to be extruded and I extruded it by 2mm.</p>

                    <p>The next thing I did was to create a text on the keychain. Firstly I created a sketch on the top surface of the keychain. I was able to change the text size, fonts, and orientation.</p>

                    <p>The last step to this process was to extrude the text. I did the same thing to extrude the text but this time I did it by 1mm.</p>
