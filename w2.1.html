                    <h3>Our websites</h3>
                    <p>As part of our assignment we were to try and start up our own websites, this website in fact. We were to try out css and html to make the website. Content-wise we were to include a home page which talks about this module, a small write up about myself and to try making a navbar.</p>
                   <h3>HTML</h3>
                    <p>For HTML, it was not too difficult. I just added the relevant information and arranged it with css.</p>
                    <h3>CSS</h1>
                    <p>For the CSS portion, I wanted to try something different. The demonstartion video had us making a navbar on the left side of the website but because I was going to place a photo of myself there, I decided to try placing the navbar on top as seen in the current arrangement. Other than that most of the elements follow roughly the same format as seen in the video.</p>
