                    <h1>Electronics</h1><hr>
                    <h3>Basics</h3>
                    <p>Today we learnt some basics of electronics. The flow of electricity is defined as the flow of electrons through different components. Ohms Law, V=IR is the basic equation of electricity which contains several key words in it, Voltage, Current, and Resistance.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Voltage</b> , also known as potential difference is the difference in electrical potential between 2 points and is measured in <b>volts</b>.</li>
                        <li><b>Current</b> , is the rate of flow of electric charges and is measured in <b>amps</b>.</li>
                        <li><b>Resistance</b> , is a measure of the opposition to the flow of the current and is measured in <b>ohms</b>.</li>
                        <li>In order for there to be current, the circuit must be closed</li>
                    </ul>
                    There are two types of current commonly used, AC and DC.
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Alternating Current(AC)</b></li>
                        <li><b>Direct Current(DC)</b></li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Electrical Components</h3>
                    <p>There are many types of electrical components out there but they can be split into 3 groups</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Insulators-prevents current flow</li>
                        <li>Conductors-allows free current flow</li>
                        <li>SemiConductors-allows current to flow only if certain conditions are met</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Common Electrical Components</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Wires-connect components together</li>
                        <li>Switches-allows the circuit to be open or close depending on the needs of the user</li>
                        <li>Power Source-DC supply like from a battery or AC supply like from a wall outlet.</li>
                    </ul>
